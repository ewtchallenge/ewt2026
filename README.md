## Engineering With Temi 2026 Challenge

### What is it?

A year-long global coding challenge designed to help junior and mid-level developers build real-world project experience through monthly guided projects, expert code reviews, and community collaboration.

Every month starting January 2026, participants are given a requirement for a project and have one month to complete it and submit a PR (pull request) containing their approaches and solutions. The PR is then reviewed by experienced engineers and the participant is given feedback. Review is conducted by humans and AI to ensure there’s a human in the loop and participants have real feedback.

The goal of this challenge is to help people gain real world experience by building projects from scratch while also collaborating and working with experienced engineers who can provide a form of indirect mentorship through code reviews. At the end of the challenge, we’d have engineers who can tackle various problems of varying difficulty and engineers who have built solutions to different problems.

It is completely free to participate and also join as a reviewer. To ensure the quality of reviews and feedback to participants, we encourage reviewers to have relevant experience (2 years+) and have demonstrated their expertise in developing/maintaining complex systems. The code contributed is open source and free to use/read by everyone.

### Timeline

- _First week:_ Project brief is provided through github and announcement video is released providing opportunity to clarify the goals and intent of the project

- _First week-fourth week:_ Participants work on developing the applications and can provide PRs in two formats:
  - Draft PR for early review and feedback: Mostly reviewed by an AI agent with optional review from a human engineer
  - Final PR: PR is now ready for human feedback and any update after the review from the engineer would not be prioritised

_NOTE: Submissions after the project timeline would not be prioritised by a human reviewer._

Communication would take place via

- Github discussions and PRs
- Discord or Skool community and Youtube
- EWT2026 hashtag on supported social accounts
